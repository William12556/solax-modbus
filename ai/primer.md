## 1.0 Purpose

This document is a concise operational primer for the Strategic Domain. It distils
`governance.md` into actionable guidance. `governance.md` is authoritative;
this document provides orientation and quick reference only.

**Prime Directive: Follow the workflow.**

## 2.0 Architecture

The framework separates software development into two domains:

| Domain | Role | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| Strategic | Plan, control, validate | Claude Desktop |
| Tactical | Execute, generate code | AEL (Ralph Loop) or Claude Code |

Communication between domains is filesystem-based (MCP). Neither domain has
direct conversational access to the other.

**Tactical Domain implementations:**

- **AEL (Autonomous Execution Loop)** — reference implementation. Runs a
  worker/reviewer cycle (Ralph Loop) until `SHIP` or `BLOCKED`. State resides
  in `ai/state/ralph/`. Requires oMLX inference endpoint and `config.yaml`.
  Context file: `ai/context.md`.
- **Claude Code** — alternative profile. Manual invocation; no automated loop.
  Uses `CLAUDE.md` at project root as tactical context file. See `ai/profiles/claude.md`.

**ael-mcp** (Claude Desktop profile, optional) — standalone MCP server exposing
`start_ael`, `ael_status`, and `reset_ael` tools to Claude Desktop. Allows the
Strategic Domain to launch AEL and query outcome without human terminal relay.
See P09 §1.10.3 Option B and P01 §1.2.8.

Implementation profiles are defined in `ai/profiles/`. The active profile
determines the tactical context file name, skills directory, and AEL configuration.

## 2.1 Tactical Profiles

| Aspect       | AEL (Primary)                       | Claude Code                   | claude-omlx                         |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Execution    | Automated Ralph Loop                | Manual                        | Manual                              |
| Inference    | oMLX → Devstral (local)             | Anthropic API → Claude Sonnet | oMLX → Devstral via Claude Code CLI |
| Loop control | `orchestrator.py`                   | Human operator                | Human operator                      |
| Context file | `ai/context.md`                     | `CLAUDE.md` (project root)    | `CLAUDE.md` (project root)          |
| Profile      | `mlx_devstral_small_2_2512_6bit.md` | `claude.md`                   | `claude-omlx.md`                    |

## 2.2 Monitoring Tools

**govwatch** — a standalone read-only TUI that monitors a downstream project's
governance state at runtime. Run from the project root:

```bash
python ai/src/govwatch.py
```

Provides: inferred workflow phase, two-tier compliance alerts (coupling
violations, `tactical_brief` validity, naming convention), document registry
grouped by UUID, and an alert summary emitted to `ai/dashboard-alerts.md` and
the clipboard (`C` key).

See `ai/doc/guide-govwatch.md` for full operational detail.

## 3.0 Responsibilities

The Strategic Domain owns the following functions:

**Planning**

- Requirements elicitation (P10)
- Three-tier design hierarchy: master → domain → component (P02)
- Name registry maintenance

**Execution Coordination**

- T04 prompt authoring and AEL command delivery (P09)
- Context budget check before every T04 prompt
- Human handoff: ready-to-execute command after approval

**Quality**

- Code review after AEL `SHIP` (or Claude Code completion)
- Test documentation and pytest generation (P06)
- Configuration audit against design baseline (P08)

**Issue Management**

- T03 issue creation from failed tests or AEL `BLOCKED` (P04)
- T02 change document creation from issues (P03)
- Issue–change one-to-one coupling enforcement

**Governance**

- Traceability matrix updates at every phase transition (P05)
- Document lifecycle management: active → closed (P00 §1.1.14)
- Git commit after every iteration increment

## 4.0 Workflow

Condensed stage sequence. See `workflow.md` for the full flowchart.

```
P01  Project Initialization  →  run budget.py
P10  Requirements            →  human approval → baseline
P02  Design (Tier 1–3)       →  human approval per tier → git tag baseline
P09  T04 Prompt              →  check context-budget.md → human approval
     AEL  →  SHIP or BLOCKED
            Option A: human runs terminal command (all profiles)
            Option B: Strategic Domain calls start_ael / polls ael_status
                      (Claude Desktop + ael-mcp only)
     Claude Code  →  human-directed execution (no loop)
       SHIP / complete  →  P08 code review → P06 test → progressive validation
       BLOCKED          →  P04 issue → P03 change → P09 new prompt
P06  Tests pass              →  human acceptance
P00  Close documents         →  move to closed/ → git commit → AEL reset
```

## 4.1 Audit Modes

Two audit modes serve P08 (governance §1.9). The operator selects by trigger phrase.

| Mode | Trigger | Actor | Procedure |
|---|---|---|---|
| Strategic | "conduct a strategic audit" | Claude Desktop | Read source via MCP, reason holistically, author `audit-<uuid>-<name>.md` (T08) inline |
| Tactical | "conduct a tactical audit" | AEL audit loop | Prepare `audit-uml.md` + `audit-index.md` + audit T04 prompt; human approval; launch per `ai/doc/guide-audit-loop.md` |

Strategic favours frontier judgement: architecture, protocol and name-registry
conformance, traceability. Tactical favours exhaustive per-item coverage and
unattended runtime (`--duration`). The orchestrator selects the audit recipe
pair automatically when `audit-index.md` is present in the state directory. If
the requested mode is unclear, ask before proceeding.

## 5.0 Protocol Reference

| Protocol | Name | Key Action |
|---|---|---|
| P00 | Governance | Master directives, architecture, document conventions |
| P01 | Project Initialization | Folder structure, `.gitignore`, venv, `budget.py` |
| P02 | Design | Three-tier hierarchy, name registry, Mermaid diagrams |
| P03 | Change | T02 from T03 issue; one-to-one coupling; trivial exemption |
| P04 | Issue | T03 from test failure or `BLOCKED`; issue–change coupling |
| P05 | Trace | Traceability matrix updates at every phase boundary |
| P06 | Test | T05 docs, pytest generation, progressive validation |
| P07 | Quality | Code validation, automated audits via AEL hooks |
| P08 | Audit | Strategic or tactical audit (§4.1); findings → issues (P04) |
| P09 | Prompt | T04 authoring, `tactical_brief`, AEL command delivery |
| P10 | Requirements | T07 elicitation before design; baseline before Tier 1 |

## 6.0 Document Conventions

### 6.1 Naming

| Pattern | Example |
|---|---|
| Master (singleton) | `design-<project>-master.md` |
| All other documents | `<class>-<8-hex-uuid>-<name>.md` |

Document classes: `design`, `change`, `issue`, `prompt`, `test`, `result`,
`audit`, `trace`, `requirements`.

**UUID propagation:** The first document created in a workflow cycle (issue or
change) generates the UUID. All coupled documents inherit it.

**Iteration:** Increments when a document re-enters a cycle after failure.
Both coupled documents (issue + change) increment together. Git commit
required after each increment.

### 6.2 Lifecycle

| State | Location | Mutability |
|---|---|---|
| Active | `ai/workspace/<class>/` | Mutable |
| Closed | `ai/workspace/<class>/closed/` | Immutable |

## 7.0 Constraints

**Forbidden**

- Creating, modifying, or deleting source code or documents without explicit
  human request (both domains).
- Exceeding the Tactical Domain context budget when authoring T04 prompts.
- Issuing an AEL command when `tactical_brief` is empty.

**Context Budget**

- `context-budget.md` must exist in `ai/state/ralph/` before authoring any T04
  prompt. If absent, instruct human to run `python ai/ael/src/budget.py`.
- Read budget before sizing `tactical_brief` (~200–400 tokens target).

**`tactical_brief` Format**

- Must be a ` ```yaml ` fenced block with `tactical_brief:` as the root key.
- Plain text blocks are not detected by the orchestrator.

**Trivial Change Exemption (P03 §1.4.12)**

- Qualifies only when both trivial AND surgical, and all five criteria met:
  single function, ≤20 line delta, no interface changes, unambiguous,
  human-approved.
- Exempt from T03 → T02 → T04 → AEL. Git commit is the sole audit record.

**Change Documentation Scope**

- Full issue/change/prompt workflow applies to `src/` changes only.
- `ai/workspace/` document changes may be made directly after human approval.

**Initial Implementation**

- First-time source code implementation from an approved design does not require issue or change documents.
- Forward path: approved design → T04 prompt → execution → review.
- The T03 → T02 corrective loop is triggered only by AEL `BLOCKED` or test failure.

## 8.0 Templates

any document.

| Template | Document Class | Location |
