## 1.0 Protocols (Directives)

#### 1.1 P00 Governance (start here)

  - §1.1.1 Purpose
    - Python based software engineering, architecture and development
  - §1.1.2 Scope
    - Agnostic plan, control and initiation of software generation
  - §1.1.3 Framework Practice
    - This governance framework defines software development processes and workflows
    - Strategic Domain/Tactical Domain separation applies to software creation, not to generated application runtime
    - Generated software/applications (outputs) are independent of framework architecture
    - Framework controls: how we build software
    - Framework does not control: how the built software operates
    - Example: \<project name\> uses this framework for development but is a standalone Python application at runtime
  - §1.1.4 Architecture (Model-Agnostic)
    - Strategic Domain: Plan and control: design, change, test and launching of code generation
      - Implementation options: Claude Desktop, API-based LLM
    - Tactical Domain: Execute: code generation
      - Implementation options: Ralph Loop (AEL), custom agents, direct invocation
    - Communication: MCP filesystem (model-independent)
  - §1.1.5 Forbidden
    - Both domains: Unrequested creation, addition, removal or change of source code and documents is forbidden
  - §1.1.6 Constraints
    - Strategic Domain: Does not exceed language model context resource budget when communicating with Tactical Domain
  - §1.1.7 Control
    - Strategic Domain: Strategic coordination and validation authority
    - Strategic Domain: Analyzes requirements and formulates design specifications
    - Strategic Domain: Creates T04 prompts with complete technical context
    - Strategic Domain: Validates Tactical Domain implementation for protocol compliance
    - Strategic Domain: Coordinates quality assurance and integration verification
    - Tactical Domain: Tactical implementation with project awareness
    - Tactical Domain: Generates source code with MCP filesystem access
    - Tactical Domain: Performs direct file operations in src/ directory
    - Tactical Domain: Validates protocol compliance through direct file access
    - Tactical Domain: Coordinates multi-file implementations and dependencies

  - §1.1.8 Communication
    - Both Strategic Domain and Tactical Domain have MCP filesystem access to project
    - Model Implementation Details:
      - Strategic Domain model specified in project configuration
      - Tactical Domain model(s) specified in execution recipes
      - Multi-model orchestration supported (e.g., worker/reviewer pattern)
    - Communication uses filesystem-based message passing (semaphores)
    - Strategic Domain: Reads template from ai/templates/T04-prompt.md
    - Strategic Domain: Uses T04 template to create code generation or debug prompts for Tactical Domain
    - Strategic Domain: Embeds complete Tier 3 component design specifications and schema within prompt documents
    - Strategic Domain: Ensures prompt documents are self-contained requiring no external file references
    - Strategic Domain: Saves T04 prompt to workspace/prompt/prompt-\<uuid\>-\<name\>.md
    - Strategic Domain: Provides ready-to-execute AEL command in conversation after human approval
    - Human: Executes AEL command from project root
    - AEL: Reads T04 prompt as task; runs worker/reviewer Ralph Loop until SHIP or BLOCKED
    - AEL SHIP: Strategic Domain reviews generated code, proceeds with audit
    - AEL BLOCKED: Strategic Domain creates T03 Issue from RALPH-BLOCKED.md content
    - Command format:
```bash
python ai/ael/src/orchestrator.py --mode loop \
  --task workspace/prompt/prompt-<uuid>-<n>.md
```
  - §1.1.9 Quality
    - Human review and approval of design, change and initiation of code generation is required
    - Strategic Domain: Provides ready-to-execute command after human approval
    - Human: Invokes Tactical Domain with provided command
    - Human: Notifies Strategic Domain when Tactical Domain completes
    - Strategic Domain: Reviews generated code before proceeding
  - §1.1.10 Documents
    - Master documents: \<document class\>-\<document name\>-master.md
      - No UUID assigned (master documents are singletons per project)
      - Examples: design-myproject-master.md, trace-traceability-matrix-master.md
    - All other documents: \<document class\>-\<uuid\>-\<document name\>.md
      - Strategic Domain: Generates 8-character UUID (first 8 hex digits of UUID v4)
      - Examples: change-a3f5b2c1-fix-parser.md, issue-d7e9f1a4-network-timeout.md
    - Strategic Domain: Design documents follow tier naming convention: master_, domain_, component_ prefixes
    - Strategic Domain: Insures related documents are Obsidian cross linked
    - Document classes that require a master document are: design, audit, trace and test
    - Design class includes a dedicated name registry master: design-\<project\>-name_registry-master.md
    - All document classes (issue, change, prompt, test, result) contain internal iteration field starting at 1
    - Iteration increments when document enters new cycle after failed verification
    - Git commit required after iteration field modification
    - Filesystem contains only current iteration; GitHub history preserves prior iterations
    - Coupled documents maintain synchronized iteration numbers via explicit UUID references

  - §1.1.11 Autonomous Execution Loop (AEL)
    - Reference implementation: Ralph Loop via Python AEL orchestrator (`ai/ael/`)
    - AEL provides autonomous iterative code generation within governance boundaries
    - Loop State Directory: `.ael/ralph/` (ephemeral, per-task)
    - Loop Entry: After human approval of T04 Prompt
    - Integration Scripts: Project-scoped scripts reside in `<project>/bin/`. Scripts are version-controlled project artifacts. Global installation (e.g. `~/bin/`) is not required.
    - Loop Execution: Worker/reviewer cycle until SHIP or boundary exceeded
    - Loop Exit: SHIP → Strategic Domain captures work-summary.txt in T06 Result; BLOCKED → Strategic Domain seeds T03 Issue from RALPH-BLOCKED.md
    - State Files:
      - `task.md`: Task description from T04
      - `iteration.txt`: Current cycle number
      - `work-summary.txt`: Worker iteration output
      - `work-complete.txt`: Worker completion signal
      - `review-result.txt`: SHIP or REVISE decision
      - `review-feedback.txt`: Reviewer notes for next iteration
      - `.ralph-complete`: Success marker
      - `RALPH-BLOCKED.md`: Failure details
    - Boundary Conditions:
      - MAX_ITERATIONS: Configurable per task (default 10-50)
      - TOKEN_BUDGET: Aggregate token limit
      - TIME_LIMIT: Wall-clock timeout
      - DIVERGENCE: Repeated failure detection
    - Traceability: Loop summary captured in T06 Result document
  - §1.1.12 Configuration Management
    - GitHub repository is authoritative source for all project artifacts
    - Human: Tags design document commits when approved as baseline for code generation via GitHub Desktop (History → right-click commit → Create Tag → Push Tags)
    - Strategic Domain: Performs configuration audit verifying generated code matches approved design baseline commits
    - Strategic Domain: Uses config-audit template from workspace/audit/config-audit-template.md
    - Strategic Domain: Verifies code matches tagged design baseline specifications
    - Strategic Domain: Documents findings in config-audit-NNNN-YYYY-MM-DD.md
    - Strategic Domain: Stores configuration audits in workspace/audit/
    - Critical deviations: Creates issues via P04 for remediation
  - §1.1.13 Versioning
    - All versioning is handled via GitHub
    - Project uses Semantic Versioning per https://semver.org
    - Format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g., 1.0.0, 1.2.3)
    - MAJOR: Incompatible API changes or major functionality changes
    - MINOR: Backwards-compatible functionality additions
    - PATCH: Backwards-compatible bug fixes
    - Pre-release versions: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-alpha.N, -beta.N, -rc.N (e.g., 1.0.0-alpha.1)

    - Git tags format: vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g., v1.0.0, v0.1.0)
    - Release notes filename: RELEASE_NOTES_vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.md
  - §1.1.14 Document Lifecycle Management
    - §1.1.14.1 Active State
      - Active documents reside in workspace/\<class\>/
      - Active documents are mutable during iteration cycles
      - Iteration field increments with each debug/refinement cycle
      - Git commit required after each iteration increment
    - §1.1.14.2 Closed State
      - Upon human acceptance, documents moved to workspace/\<class\>/closed/
      - Closed documents are immutable
      - Closed documents preserve final iteration number
      - Access: Read-only reference for future work
    - §1.1.14.3 Closure Criteria
      - Issue: Resolved and verified, corresponding change implemented and tested
      - Change: Implemented, tested, design updated, human accepted
      - Prompt: Code generated successfully, human confirmed
      - Test: Executed with passing results, result document created
      - Result: Tests passed, no issues created, acceptance confirmed
      - Audit: All critical findings resolved, high-priority findings addressed or mitigated, human approved
    - §1.1.14.4 Archival Procedure
      - Human initiates closure after acceptance
      - Strategic Domain verifies closure criteria met
      - Strategic Domain moves coupled document set to respective closed/ subfolders
      - Git commit records closure transition
      - Closed documents referenced but not modified
    - §1.1.14.5 Closed Subfolder Structure
      - workspace/issues/closed/
      - workspace/change/closed/
      - workspace/prompt/closed/
      - workspace/audit/closed/
      - workspace/test/closed/
      - workspace/test/result/closed/
    - §1.1.14.6 Access Constraints
      - Closed documents: Read-only access for reference
      - No modifications permitted to closed documents
      - New work requires new document with new sequence number
      - Reopening closed work: Create new issue referencing closed documents
  - §1.1.15 Logging Standards
    - Generated applications implement environment-based log level control
    - Debug mode enables verbose logging for development and testing
    - Normal mode restricts logging to informational events only
    - Flat file format recommended: timestamp level logger message
    - Centralized log location per application requirements
    - Log rotation policy prevents disk exhaustion
    - Test environments use debug mode for comprehensive logging
    - Production environments use normal mode for operational efficiency
    - Log artifacts preserved for failure analysis
  - §1.1.16 Knowledge Base
    - Strategic Domain: Consults workspace/knowledge/ before creating documents or code
    - Tactical Domain: Consults workspace/knowledge/ before implementing changes
    - Both domains: Add newly discovered patterns and solutions to knowledge base
    - Knowledge documents contain: problem statements, solutions, examples, rationale
    - Behavioral standards: workspace/knowledge/behavioral-standards.yaml defines deterministic behavioral constraints for autonomous execution
    - Behavioral standards: Referenced in T04 prompts via behavioral_standards.source field
    - Behavioral standards: Enforcement levels (strict, advisory, disabled) control constraint application
    - Knowledge base prevents repeated problem-solving across development cycles
  - §1.1.17 Templates

    - Templates contain YAML structure and JSON Schema validation rules
  - §1.1.18 Skills Management
    - Tactical Domain: Utilizes skills from <skills_dir>/ for reusable workflows
    - Skills organization: governance/, testing/, validation/, audit/ subdirectories
    - Hot-reload enabled: Skill modifications activate without session restart
    - Forked contexts: Validation skills execute in isolated sub-agent contexts
    - Lifecycle hooks: PreToolUse (schema validation), PostToolUse (compliance verification), Stop (cleanup)
    - Skills repository: Project-specific skills checked into git for team sharing
    - Personal skills: ~/<skills_dir>/ for individual workflow preferences
    - Implementation: See implementation profile in ai/profiles/

      - audit/protocol-compliance.md: Check generated code against protocol requirements
  - §1.1.19 Context Optimization
    - Tactical Domain context file location: Project root (checked into git for team sharing)
    - Local context file: Personal preferences (.gitignore'd)
    - Content specification:
      - Project overview and technology stack
      - Common bash commands (build, test, lint)
      - Code style guidelines
      - Repository conventions (branch naming, commit patterns)
      - Governance framework location: ai/governance.md
      - Design documents location: workspace/design/
      - Protocol compliance requirements summary
      - Platform-specific tooling and dependencies
    - Token efficiency: Externalize stable context from T04 prompts
