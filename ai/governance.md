## 1.0 Protocols (Directives)

#### 1.1 P00 Governance (start here)

  - §1.1.1 Purpose
    - Python based software engineering, architecture and development
  - §1.1.2 Scope
    - Agnostic plan, control and initiation of software generation
  - §1.1.3 Framework Practice
    - This governance framework defines software development processes and workflows
    - Strategic Domain/Tactical Domain separation applies to software creation, not to generated application runtime
    - Generated software/applications (outputs) are independent of framework architecture
    - Framework controls: how we build software
    - Framework does not control: how the built software operates
    - Example: \<project name\> uses this framework for development but is a standalone Python application at runtime
  - §1.1.4 Architecture (Model-Agnostic)
    - Strategic Domain: Plan and control: design, change, test and launching of code generation
      - Implementation options: Claude Desktop, API-based LLM
    - Tactical Domain: Execute: code generation
      - Implementation options: Ralph Loop (AEL), Claude Code, claude-omlx, custom agents, direct invocation
    - Communication: MCP filesystem (model-independent)
  - §1.1.5 Forbidden
    - Both domains: Unrequested creation, addition, removal or change of source code and documents is forbidden
  - §1.1.6 Constraints
    - Strategic Domain: Does not exceed language model context resource budget when communicating with Tactical Domain
  - §1.1.7 Control
    - Strategic Domain: Strategic coordination and validation authority
    - Strategic Domain: Analyzes requirements and formulates design specifications
    - Strategic Domain: Creates T04 prompts with complete technical context
    - Strategic Domain: Validates Tactical Domain implementation for protocol compliance
    - Strategic Domain: Coordinates quality assurance and integration verification
    - Tactical Domain: Tactical implementation with project awareness
    - Tactical Domain: Generates source code with MCP filesystem access
    - Tactical Domain: Performs direct file operations in src/ directory
    - Tactical Domain: Validates protocol compliance through direct file access
    - Tactical Domain: Coordinates multi-file implementations and dependencies

  - §1.1.8 Communication
    - Both Strategic Domain and Tactical Domain have MCP filesystem access to project
    - Model Implementation Details:
      - Strategic Domain model specified in project configuration
      - Tactical Domain model(s) specified in execution recipes
      - Multi-model orchestration supported (e.g., worker/reviewer pattern)
    - Communication uses filesystem-based message passing (semaphores)
    - Strategic Domain: Reads template from ai/templates/T04-prompt.md
    - Strategic Domain: Uses T04 template to create code generation or debug prompts for Tactical Domain
    - Strategic Domain: Embeds complete Tier 3 component design specifications and schema within prompt documents
    - Strategic Domain: Ensures prompt documents are self-contained requiring no external file references
    - Strategic Domain: Saves T04 prompt to ai/workspace/prompt/prompt-\<uuid\>-\<name\>.md
    - Strategic Domain: Provides ready-to-execute AEL command in conversation after human approval
    - Human: Executes AEL command from project root
    - AEL: Reads T04 prompt as task; runs worker/reviewer Ralph Loop until SHIP or BLOCKED
    - AEL SHIP: Strategic Domain reviews generated code, proceeds with audit
    - AEL BLOCKED: Strategic Domain creates T03 Issue from RALPH-BLOCKED.md content
    - Command format:
```bash
python ai/ael/src/orchestrator.py --mode loop \
  --task ai/workspace/prompt/prompt-<uuid>-<n>.md
```
  - §1.1.9 Quality
    - Human review and approval of design, change and initiation of code generation is required
    - Strategic Domain: Provides ready-to-execute command after human approval
    - Human: Invokes Tactical Domain with provided command
    - Human: Notifies Strategic Domain when Tactical Domain completes
    - Strategic Domain: Reviews generated code before proceeding
  - §1.1.10 Documents
    - Master documents: \<document class\>-\<document name\>-master.md
      - No UUID assigned (master documents are singletons per project)
      - Examples: design-myproject-master.md, trace-traceability-matrix-master.md
    - All other documents: \<document class\>-\<uuid\>-\<document name\>.md
      - Strategic Domain: Generates 8-character UUID (first 8 hex digits of UUID v4)
      - Examples: change-a3f5b2c1-fix-parser.md, issue-d7e9f1a4-network-timeout.md
    - Strategic Domain: Design documents follow tier naming convention: master_, domain_, component_ prefixes
    - Strategic Domain: Insures related documents are Obsidian cross linked
    - Document classes that require a master document are: design, audit, trace and test
    - Design class includes a dedicated name registry master: design-\<project\>-name_registry-master.md
    - All document classes (issue, change, prompt, test, result) contain internal iteration field starting at 1
    - Iteration increments when document enters new cycle after failed verification
    - Git commit required after iteration field modification
    - Filesystem contains only current iteration; GitHub history preserves prior iterations
    - Coupled documents maintain synchronized iteration numbers via explicit UUID references

  - §1.1.11 Autonomous Execution Loop (AEL)
    - Reference implementation: Ralph Loop via Python AEL orchestrator (`ai/ael/`)
    - AEL provides autonomous iterative code generation within governance boundaries
    - Loop State Directory: `ai/state/ralph/` (ephemeral, per-task)
    - Loop Entry: After human approval of T04 Prompt
    - Integration Scripts: Project-scoped scripts reside in `<project>/bin/`. Scripts are version-controlled project artifacts. Global installation (e.g. `~/bin/`) is not required.
    - Claude Desktop Interface: `ael-mcp` (standalone repository) provides `start_ael`, `ael_status`, and `reset_ael` MCP tools for use within the Claude Desktop profile; registers once in Claude Desktop MCP configuration; serves all downstream projects via `project_dir` parameter; reference: §1.2.8
    - Loop Execution: Worker/reviewer cycle until SHIP or boundary exceeded
    - Loop Exit: SHIP → Strategic Domain captures work-summary.txt in T06 Result; BLOCKED → Strategic Domain seeds T03 Issue from RALPH-BLOCKED.md
    - State Files:
      - `task.md`: Task description from T04
      - `iteration.txt`: Current cycle number
      - `work-summary.txt`: Worker iteration output
      - `work-complete.txt`: Worker completion signal
      - `review-result.txt`: SHIP or REVISE decision
      - `review-feedback.txt`: Reviewer notes for next iteration
      - `.ralph-complete`: Success marker
      - `RALPH-BLOCKED.md`: Failure details
    - Boundary Conditions:
      - MAX_ITERATIONS: Configurable per task (default 10-50)
      - TOKEN_BUDGET: Aggregate token limit
      - TIME_LIMIT: Wall-clock timeout
      - DIVERGENCE: Repeated failure detection
    - Traceability: Loop summary captured in T06 Result document
  - §1.1.12 Configuration Management
    - GitHub repository is authoritative source for all project artifacts
    - Human: Tags design document commits when approved as baseline for code generation via GitHub Desktop (History → right-click commit → Create Tag → Push Tags)
    - Strategic Domain: Performs configuration audit verifying generated code matches approved design baseline commits
    - Strategic Domain: Uses config-audit template from ai/workspace/audit/config-audit-template.md
    - Strategic Domain: Verifies code matches tagged design baseline specifications
    - Strategic Domain: Documents findings in config-audit-NNNN-YYYY-MM-DD.md
    - Strategic Domain: Stores configuration audits in ai/workspace/audit/
    - Critical deviations: Creates issues via P04 for remediation
  - §1.1.13 Versioning
    - All versioning is handled via GitHub
    - Project uses Semantic Versioning per https://semver.org
    - Format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g., 1.0.0, 1.2.3)
    - MAJOR: Incompatible API changes or major functionality changes
    - MINOR: Backwards-compatible functionality additions
    - PATCH: Backwards-compatible bug fixes

    - Git tags format: vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g., v1.0.0, v0.1.0)
    - Release notes filename: RELEASE_NOTES_vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.md
  - §1.1.14 Document Lifecycle Management
    - §1.1.14.1 Active State
      - Active documents reside in ai/workspace/\<class\>/
      - Active documents are mutable during iteration cycles
      - Iteration field increments with each debug/refinement cycle
      - Git commit required after each iteration increment
    - §1.1.14.2 Closed State
      - Upon human acceptance, documents moved to ai/workspace/\<class\>/closed/
      - Closed documents are immutable
      - Closed documents preserve final iteration number
      - Access: Read-only reference for future work
    - §1.1.14.3 Closure Criteria
      - Issue: Resolved and verified, corresponding change implemented and tested
      - Change: Implemented, tested, design updated, human accepted
      - Prompt: Code generated successfully, human confirmed
      - Test: Executed with passing results, result document created
      - Result: Tests passed, no issues created, acceptance confirmed
      - Audit: All critical findings resolved, high-priority findings addressed or mitigated, human approved
    - §1.1.14.4 Archival Procedure
      - Human initiates closure after acceptance
      - Strategic Domain verifies closure criteria met
      - Strategic Domain moves coupled document set to respective closed/ subfolders
      - Git commit records closure transition
      - Closed documents referenced but not modified
    - §1.1.14.5 Closed Subfolder Structure

    - §1.1.14.6 Access Constraints
      - Closed documents: Read-only access for reference
      - No modifications permitted to closed documents
      - New work requires new document with new sequence number
      - Reopening closed work: Create new issue referencing closed documents
  - §1.1.15 Logging Standards
    - Generated applications implement environment-based log level control
    - Debug mode enables verbose logging for development and testing
    - Normal mode restricts logging to informational events only
    - Flat file format recommended: timestamp level logger message
    - Centralized log location per application requirements
    - Log rotation policy prevents disk exhaustion
    - Test environments use debug mode for comprehensive logging
    - Production environments use normal mode for operational efficiency
    - Log artifacts preserved for failure analysis
  - §1.1.16 Knowledge Base
    - Projects may optionally maintain a knowledge/ subdirectory under ai/workspace/ for institutional knowledge capture
    - Knowledge documents may contain: problem statements, solutions, examples, rationale
    - Knowledge base prevents repeated problem-solving across development cycles
  - §1.1.17 Templates

    - Templates contain YAML structure and JSON Schema validation rules
  - §1.1.18 Skills Management (Claude Code profiles only)
    - Tactical Domain: Utilizes skills from .claude/ for reusable workflows
    - Skills organization: governance/, testing/, validation/, audit/ subdirectories under .claude/
    - Hot-reload enabled: Skill modifications activate without session restart
    - Forked contexts: Validation skills execute in isolated sub-agent contexts
    - Lifecycle hooks: PreToolUse (schema validation), PostToolUse (compliance verification), Stop (cleanup)
    - Skills repository: Project-specific skills checked into git for team sharing
    - Implementation: See ai/profiles/claude.md or ai/profiles/claude-omlx.md
    - Common skills examples:
      - .claude/governance/validate-design.md: Schema validation before T04 prompt creation
      - .claude/testing/generate-pytest.md: Automated pytest generation from T05 documentation
      - .claude/validation/coupling-check.md: Verify iteration synchronization in coupled documents
      - .claude/audit/protocol-compliance.md: Check generated code against protocol requirements
  - §1.1.19 Context Optimization
    - Tactical Domain context file location:
      - AEL profile: ai/context.md (checked into git)
      - Claude Code profiles: CLAUDE.md at project root (checked into git)
    - Local context file: Personal preferences (.gitignore'd)
      - Claude Code profiles: CLAUDE.local.md at project root
    - AEL auto-load: worker recipe reads project_root/ai/context.md at task start if present
    - Content specification:
      - Project overview and technology stack
      - Common bash commands (build, test, lint)
      - Code style guidelines
      - Repository conventions (branch naming, commit patterns)
      - Governance framework location: ai/governance.md
      - Design documents location: ai/workspace/design/
      - Protocol compliance requirements summary
      - Platform-specific tooling and dependencies
    - Token efficiency: Externalize stable context from T04 prompts
    - Team coordination: Review context file changes during git commits
    - Auto-generation: Strategic Domain creates initial context file during project initialization or when absent
    - Implementation: Context file name and update mechanism defined in implementation profile (ai/profiles/)

#### 1.4 P03 Change
  - §1.4.1 Change document creation
    - Strategic Domain: Reads template from ai/templates/T02-change.md
    - Strategic Domain: Creates change documents exclusively from issue documents using T02 template and saves them in folder ai/workspace/change
    - Strategic Domain: For human-requested source code changes, first creates issue document via P04, then creates change document referencing that issue
    - Strategic Domain: For enhancement or requirement change requests, creates issue document via P04 with type `enhancement` or `requirement_change` and origin `requirement_change`, then creates change document referencing that issue
    - Exception: Non-source-code changes (ai/workspace/ documents per 1.4.10) may be implemented directly after human approval without issue/change documents
    - Exception: Initial implementation of source code from an approved design document does not require issue or change documents. The forward path is: approved design → T04 prompt → Tactical Domain execution → review. Issue and change documents are required only when execution fails (AEL BLOCKED) or tests fail.
  - §1.4.2 Document coupling
    - Strategic Domain: Ensures one-to-one coupling between issue and change documents
    - Strategic Domain: Every source code change document must reference exactly one source issue document via UUID
    - Strategic Domain: Every resolved source code issue must reference exactly one change document via UUID

    - Strategic Domain: Cross-links updated documents to source change document
  - §1.4.11 Documentation domain
    - Change documentation is only required for source code changes in src/. Change documentation to documents in the ai/workspace/ is not required and can be made directly after human approval.
  - §1.4.12 Trivial Change Exemption
    - Definitions:
      - Trivial: the outcome is fully predictable before implementation; no analysis, experimentation, or design judgement is required to determine the correct solution.
      - Surgical: confined to a single, well-bounded location in the codebase; does not disturb surrounding logic, interfaces, or dependent components.
    - A qualifying change must be both trivial and surgical simultaneously. Either quality alone is insufficient.
    - When all five criteria below are satisfied, Strategic Domain may implement directly after human approval — no T03, T02, T04, or AEL required. Git commit history is the sole audit record for exempt changes.
    - Criteria (all must hold simultaneously):
      - (1) Confined to a single function or entry point
      - (2) Net line delta ≤20 lines
      - (3) No interface changes (signatures, contracts, public APIs)
      - (4) Unambiguous with no design decisions required
      - (5) Human approval obtained before implementation
    - If any criterion fails, standard T03 → T02 → T04 → AEL workflow applies.

#### 1.10 P09 Prompt
  - §1.10.1 Purpose
    - Manage creation and lifecycle of T04 prompt documents
    - Facilitate Strategic Domain → Tactical Domain code generation communication
  - §1.10.2 Prompt Creation
    - Prompt documents are always Tactical Domain specific.
    - Strategic Domain: Reads template from ai/templates/T04-prompt.md
    - Strategic Domain: Creates prompt documents from design and change documents using T04 template
    - Strategic Domain: Saves prompts with naming format prompt-<uuid>-<name>.md in ai/workspace/prompt/
    - Strategic Domain: UUID assignment follows workflow initiation pattern:
    - First document created in workflow (Issue OR Change) generates new 8-character UUID
    - All subsequently coupled documents (Change, Prompt, Test, Result) inherit that UUID
    - UUID propagates through entire document lifecycle maintaining referential integrity
    - Strategic Domain: Rewrites prompt documents in place when revisions required
    - Strategic Domain: Embeds complete design specifications and schema within prompt documents
    - Strategic Domain: Ensures prompt documents are self-contained requiring no external file references
    - Strategic Domain: Populates tactical_brief field with a concise plain-text AEL task payload (~200-400 tokens); brief contains only: file(s) to modify, hard constraints, implementation steps, deliverable path(s), success criteria; all governance metadata omitted from brief
    - Strategic Domain: Checks whether context-budget.md exists in AEL state directory before authoring tactical_brief; if absent, instructs human to run `python ai/ael/src/budget.py` from project root before proceeding
    - Strategic Domain: Reads context-budget.md and adjusts brief size to fit within available context headroom
    - Strategic Domain: Verifies tactical_brief field is non-empty before issuing AEL command; an empty or placeholder brief causes orchestrator fallback to full raw document, inflating context and risking saturation
    - Strategic Domain: Ensures tactical_brief is authored in a ```yaml fenced block with tactical_brief as the root key; the orchestrator scans only ```yaml blocks — plain text or non-YAML fenced blocks are not detected and cause fallback to raw document; when using per-section YAML blocks, §8.0 must be a dedicated ```yaml block (not ```text) with tactical_brief: as the sole root key
    - Strategic Domain: config.yaml `loop.max_iterations` controls the number of outer Ralph Loop cycles (worker + reviewer pass pairs); `loop.phase_max_iterations` controls the number of inner tool-call iterations per phase; these are distinct values and must not be conflated in T04 prompt notes
    - Strategic Domain: AEL end is logged as `INFO AEL end rc=N` in the .LOG file on all exits including unexpected termination; absence of this line in a log indicates unclean exit (signal, crash, or resource failure); log review should check for this line before concluding outcome
    - Strategic Domain: Before specifying any target file path in a T04 prompt, reads the project entry point configuration (pyproject.toml [project.scripts] or equivalent) and confirms the named file is in the deployment path
    - Strategic Domain: Embeds element_registry field in T04 prompt from name registry master, scoped to elements relevant to the code generation task
    - Strategic Domain: Prompt references source change UUID in coupled_docs.change_ref field
    - Strategic Domain: Prompt iteration number matches source change iteration number
    - Strategic Domain: Iteration synchronization maintained through debug cycles
    - Strategic Domain: Verifies coupling before prompt creation
    - GitHub version control maintains complete revision history
  - §1.10.3 Human Handoff
    - Strategic Domain: Verifies tactical context file exists at project root before providing command
    - Strategic Domain: If context file absent, generates initial context file with project context
    - Strategic Domain: Generated context file requires human approval before proceeding
    - Context file name: Defined in implementation profile (ai/profiles/)
    - Strategic Domain: After human approval of T04 prompt, presents AEL execution options; human selects preferred option:
    - **Option A — Human executes (all profiles):**
      - Strategic Domain: Provides ready-to-execute AEL command in conversation
      - Human: Executes command from project root directory
      - AEL exits with SHIP (proceed to review) or BLOCKED (create T03 Issue)
      - Human: Notifies Strategic Domain of AEL outcome
      - Example command:

```bash
python ai/ael/src/orchestrator.py --mode loop \
  --task ai/workspace/prompt/prompt-<uuid>-<n>.md
```

    - **Option B — Strategic Domain launches via ael-mcp (Claude Desktop profile only):**
      - Human: Chooses to delegate AEL launch to Strategic Domain
      - Strategic Domain: Calls `start_ael` with `project_dir` and T04 prompt path as `task` parameter
      - AEL runs detached; Strategic Domain returns `run_id`, PID, and log path
      - Human: Requests status check when ready
      - Strategic Domain: Calls `ael_status`; reports SHIP or BLOCKED outcome
      - On BLOCKED: Strategic Domain reads `RALPH-BLOCKED.md` and creates T03 Issue per P04

  - §1.10.4 Wildcard Permissions
    - Tactical Domain: Supports wildcard patterns in permission grants for batch operations
    - Permission scope: src/**/*.py enables modifications across source tree
    - Validation: PreToolUse hooks verify modifications within approved scope
    - Audit trail: All wildcard-permitted modifications logged per-file
    - Human approval: Wildcard grants require explicit approval in T04 prompt
    - Rollback capability: Checkpoint system preserves state before each modification
    - Use cases: Refactoring, formatting, batch updates, code migrations
    - Constraints: Wildcard permissions limited to src/ directory tree
    - Exclusions: Configuration files, test fixtures require individual approval
  - §1.10.5 Prompt Revision
    - Strategic Domain: Rewrites existing prompt documents when changes needed
    - Strategic Domain: Documents revision rationale in prompt version_history section
    - GitHub commits provide complete change tracking and rollback capability

| 8.3     | 2026-03-24 | Added tactical_brief verification directive to P09 §1.10.2: Strategic Domain must verify tactical_brief is non-empty before issuing AEL command; T04 template v1.6 removes governance-only fields and fixes placeholder |
| 8.4     | 2026-03-25 | Added tactical_brief format constraint to P09 §1.10.2: tactical_brief must be authored in a ```yaml block with tactical_brief as root key; per-section prompts must not use ```text for §8.0; plain text blocks are invisible to orchestrator extract_tactical_brief function |
| 8.5     | 2026-03-25 | Orchestrator improvements from AEL log analysis: (1) extract_tactical_brief adds section-header fallback (Pass 2) recovering brief from plain fenced block under ## N.N Tactical Brief heading; fallback emits WARNING not DEBUG; (2) main_async pre-initialises rc=1 and logs `AEL end rc=N` in finally block to distinguish clean vs unclean termination; P09 §1.10.2: added directives clarifying max_iterations (outer cycles) vs phase_max_iterations (inner tool-call iterations) and AEL end log semantics |
| 8.6     | 2026-03-26 | Added P06 §1.7.18 Test Constraint Summary: quick-reference constraint table consolidated from testing-standards.md |
| 8.7     | 2026-03-26 | Removed behavioral standards directives from P00 §1.1.16: behavioral-standards.yaml, schema, and validator deprecated — no operational function in orchestrator; content duplicates governance protocols |
| 8.8     | 2026-03-29 | Extracted §2.0 Workflow flowchart to workflow.md; replaced §2.0 body with link; updated ToC entry and Prime Directive cross-reference |
| 8.9     | 2026-04-28 | Added ael-mcp integration: P00 §1.1.11 Claude Desktop Interface directive; P09 §1.10.3 Option A/B AEL execution (human executes or Strategic Domain launches via ael-mcp); P01 §1.2.8 ael-mcp setup steps for Claude Desktop profile |
| 9.0     | 2026-04-30 | Added claude-omlx as Tactical Domain implementation option: §1.1.4 implementation options; §1.2.8 claude-omlx profile setup steps; fixed claude.md reference path (deprecated/ → profiles/) |
| 9.1     | 2026-06-14 | Consolidated framework footprint under ai/: relocated workspace/ → ai/workspace/ across P00–P10 path references; loop state .ael/ralph/ → ai/state/ralph/ (§1.1.11); updated §1.2.2 .gitignore and §1.2.6 folder structure for ai/ layout; added ai/state/ and ai/dashboard-alerts.md; documented fork isolation mode; CLAUDE.md retained at project root (Claude Code profile) |
| 9.2     | 2026-06-16 | Updated P01 §1.2.4: replaced skel/ copy workflow with bin/propagate.sh; framework is now a single unified ai/ directory |
| 9.3     | 2026-06-16 | §1.1.17: T01-T06 → T01-T07; added T07-requirements.md to file list; §1.1.16: knowledge/ made optional; §1.2.6: knowledge/ marked optional; §1.3.8: removed mandatory knowledge/ directive |
| 9.4     | 2026-06-16 | P08 §1.9: merged duplicate "Audit Closure" sections — former §1.9.7 (short form) folded into former §1.9.9 (subsectioned form); renumbered §1.9.8 Audit Trail → §1.9.7, merged Audit Closure §1.9.9 → §1.9.8 (subsections §1.9.8.1–.4); updated cross-references in ai/doc/guide-audit-loop.md and docs/guide-audit-loop.md |
| 9.5     | 2026-06-17 | Simplified Tactical Domain configuration: removed <tactical_config>/<skills_dir>/commands placeholders from §1.2.6; added ai/context.md (AEL profile) and .claude/ block (Claude Code profiles only) to §1.2.6; scoped §1.1.18 Skills Management to Claude Code profiles; updated §1.1.19 context file paths per profile |
| 9.6     | 2026-06-17 | Added ai/context.md template; ralph-work.yaml v1.3.0 reads project_root/ai/context.md at task start; §1.1.19 notes AEL auto-load behaviour |
| 9.7     | 2026-06-17 | Renamed ai/workspace/admin/ → ai/workspace/report/ in §1.2.2 .gitignore template and §1.2.6 folder structure; added report/closed/ to §1.2.6 and §1.1.14.5 |
| 9.8     | 2026-06-25 | Added P03 §1.4.1 exception: initial implementation from approved design does not require issue or change documents; forward path is design → T04 → execution → review; corrective loop triggered only by AEL BLOCKED or test failure |
