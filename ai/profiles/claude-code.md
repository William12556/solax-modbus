## 1.0 Overview

This profile maps governance abstract placeholders to Claude Code tooling. It is an optional alternative to the MLX/Devstral profile, intended for use when the local inference stack is unavailable.

Claude Code fulfils both the worker and reviewer roles in a single manual pass. There is no automated AEL loop; the human operator controls the workflow and performs the review gate.

| Concern | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Strategic Domain | Claude Desktop (preferred) |
| Tactical Domain | Claude Code |
| AEL mechanism | Manual — human invokes Claude Code per task |

## 2.0 Placeholder Mappings

| Placeholder | Resolved Value |
|---|---|
| `<tactical_context>` | `CLAUDE.md` |
| Local context file | `CLAUDE.local.md` |

`.claude/` is the native Claude Code configuration directory; it is not a framework placeholder.

## 3.0 Strategic Domain

**Preferred implementation:** Claude Desktop

Any frontier model with sufficient reasoning capability may substitute. The Strategic Domain role requires: planning, governance interpretation, design creation, prompt authoring, and validation.

## 4.0 Tactical Domain

**Implementation:** Claude Code

Configuration directory: `.claude/`

Context file: `CLAUDE.md` at project root (checked into git).

Local context file: `CLAUDE.local.md` at project root (`.gitignore`'d).

**Prerequisites:**
- Anthropic API key configured
- Claude Code installed: `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`

## 5.0 Claude Code Task invocation

Claude Code fulfils both the worker and reviewer roles in a single manual pass. There is no worker/reviewer cycle; the human operator performs the review gate.

**Procedure:**

1. Strategic Domain authors and approves the T03 prompt per the standard workflow.
2. Open Claude Code in the project root.
3. Issue the following instruction, substituting the actual T03 file path:

```
Implement ai/workspace/prompt/prompt-<uuid>-<name>.md and close the prompt T-Doc
when finished. Leave the issue and change T-Docs active pending test results.
Then, once finished, write a report of what you have done in
ai/workspace/report/report-<uuid>-<name>.md.
```

4. Claude Code reads the T03 prompt from disk and implements the task.
5. The human operator reviews the result and accepts or requests changes.

Reference: `ai/governance.md` P13.3 Option C.
