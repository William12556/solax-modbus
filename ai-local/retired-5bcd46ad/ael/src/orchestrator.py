"""
AEL Orchestrator — Ralph Loop.

Standalone tool loop: connects directly to MCP servers, sends tool
definitions to oMLX, parses model tool calls (OpenAI and Mistral
plain-text formats), dispatches tools, injects results, iterates
until no tool calls remain.

Modes:
    worker   — single work phase pass
    reviewer — single review phase pass
    loop     — full worker/reviewer Ralph Loop cycle
    reset    — clear state directory after human acceptance

Usage:
    python orchestrator.py --mode worker   --task ai/workspace/prompt/prompt-abc123.md
    python orchestrator.py --mode reviewer --task ai/workspace/prompt/prompt-abc123.md
    python orchestrator.py --mode loop     --task ai/workspace/prompt/prompt-abc123.md
    python orchestrator.py --mode loop     --task "implement the login module"
    python orchestrator.py --mode reset
